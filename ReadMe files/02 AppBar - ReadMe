Coding Decision:

1. Terminal> flutter run --release     <== to allow app to launch from homescreen of actual device

2. SystemChrome.setPreferredOrientations   <== set app to always display in landscape mode

        main.dart ---
            import package:flutter/services.dart
            Put the SystemChrome.setPreferredOrientations inside the Widget build() method.

3. Add  flutter_launcher_name   <== Change the app display name
        https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_name
        pubspec.yaml ---
            dev_dependencies:
              flutter_launcher_name: "^0.0.1"

            flutter_launcher_name:
              name: "yourNewAppLauncherName"
        Terminal>
        flutter pub get
        flutter pub run flutter_launcher_name:main
